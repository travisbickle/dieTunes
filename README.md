# dieTunes
Mac OS X app to kill iTunes

If you are like me, and you have to host daily video conferences, and for that you must connect multiple headsets to your Mac, you will most likely be greeted with that awesome and undocumented feature of Mac OS: automatic launching iTunes when you connect some headsets, for God-knows-whatever-reason (it isn’t for any real user need, that’s for sure).
This feature is so awesome, it is impossible to turn off. The simplest way to do that is to slap a “sudo chmod 000” on the damned thing, but that way you won’t be able to use it at all. But now you have a real solution for this problem: the amazing dieTunes™ !


dieTunes™ is polling the list of running applications every 5 seconds, and automagically killing that pesky nuisance of software known as “iTunes”. 
If, by any cruel twist of fate, you are obliged to actually use that damned thing, you must first quit dieTunes™ and then you can safely launch that obnoxious thingy again.

Personally, I recommend installing dieTunes™ as a startup item, so the world can become, once again, a safe place without unwanted software jumping up and down on your Dock.

Enjoy.
